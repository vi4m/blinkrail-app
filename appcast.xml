                    ## ✨ New Features

- **Global hotkey for creating new tasks**  
  Added a configurable system-wide shortcut to instantly create a new task.  
  Default: `⌃⌘N`  
  Includes a new settings section with shortcut customization and help text.

- **Media key support (Play/Pause/Skip)**  
  Full macOS media key monitoring using CGEvent tap (with local → global fallback).  
  Hardware media keys now directly control play/pause/skip in the app.

- **Zoom meeting detection & smart pause behavior**  
  Automatically detects active Zoom meetings (with daily timer and status display).  
  While in a meeting: music is paused and break reminders are disabled.

- **Dedicated Debug window**  
  All debug tools moved from the dashboard tab into a separate, scrollable Debug window.  
  Includes preview panes, live monitoring, zoom window dumps, and easy launcher button.

## 🎉 Improvements

- **Enhanced celebration animations**  
  Added bold congratulatory headline for successful completions.  
  Undo/reverse celebrations now use grayscale styling and updated messaging.

- **Smarter nag banner behavior**  
  - Explicit **OK** acknowledgment button added  
  - **Snooze** (5 minutes) option appears after repeated quick-confirms  
  - Snooze counter resets properly — no more auto-snooze spam  
  - Banner window level raised for reliable visibility over fullscreen apps

- **GitHub sync improvements**  
  New secondary action in the upload sheet: **Clear updates-only items**  
  Resets sync flags for metadata-only changes, refreshes list, and shows status.

## 🛠 Fixes & Behavior Tweaks

- **Focus session lifecycle fixes**  
  - Sessions no longer auto-complete on expiry → now prompts to extend time  
  - Spent focus time preserved correctly when toggling or finishing tasks  
  - Deleting a task interrupts any active focus session  
  - Resuming tasks no longer reuses old focus time incorrectly  
  - Added drag-to-undo gesture for completed tasks  
  - Improved alignment of progress/focus controls on older macOS layouts
